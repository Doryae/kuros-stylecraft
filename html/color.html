            There is a lot to talk about colors...

                    Such as the chromatic circle, the warm and cold colors, what's saturation and how it works. Then there's tints, shadow, 
                    tones. And what about all symbolics about those color or even somes theories to know which color to choose ? To pair 
                    well with the others ?

                It's just my honest and humble opinion, but a website that can be accessed by everyone is what we should tend to create.
                And so, here, you will find some color palettes meant to respect as much as possible the norms of color contrast as 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">recommanded by the WCAG 2.1</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are ready to go, and you'll see graphical
                indicators to know which level of contrast you can expect between each colors of a designated palette, and to which level of
                accessibility they'll work for. (<span>AA</span> or <span>AAA</span>)
